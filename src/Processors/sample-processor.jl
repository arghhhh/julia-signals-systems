# to define a processor which produces one and only one output per input,
# define the processor as a struct P
# and define the functions process( p::P, x        ) returning y,next_state
#                   and    process( p::P, x, state ) returning y,next_state
# The size of the output is the same as that of the input
# The eltype is by default, the same as the input.
# This default can be overriden by defining 
#     Base.eltype( ::Type{Apply{I,P}})
# as usual.  There is a helper struct SeqT that exists to help define eltype
# and process(..) when the input type is known. 

# having a processor category that always produces one and only one output 
# for each input makes it possible to easily define processors that combine other 
# processors in parallel - eg adding/subtracting processors, or have a vector of 
# processors act on a vector input

#  ( fir + 1 ) means add the constant sequence one

# fir + Sequences.Sequence(1) 
# fir + 1 

# this ambiguity resoved by defaulting to treating constant numbers as infinite length sequences
# Use Gain() or similar to add a parallel path
